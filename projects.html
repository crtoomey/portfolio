        This CodeCademy project was just some dumb fun. The instructions were to loop through two arrays of strings in JavaScript
        and combine them to generate a message and display that message on a webpage. I decided to take some famous philosophy quotes 
        for the first array. For the second array I decided to take Chief Keef ab libs and add them to the philosophy quotes. 
        To complete the message I added "-Chief Keef" to make it seem like the Almighty Sosa said it himself.
        <br>
        This was one of my first JavaScript projects and I ran into a few problems along the way. The first one I had to deal with
        was the fact that you could press the "Generate" button an infinite amount of times, each time generating the same message. I'll admit it
        took me a while to make the button only clickable once but I eventually got it. However, this introduced another problem, you could only
        hit the "Generate" button once. To fix this I made a "Reset" button that just refreshed the page.
